The display: flex; property in CSS is used to create a flexible layout on a container element.
It allows the child elements (flex items) to adjust their widths and heights to best fill the available space in the container.

Here are some key features of a flex container:

The flex container's child elements can be laid out in any direction and can have flexible growth and shrink factors.
Flex items can be aligned both horizontally and vertically within the container.
The order of flex items can be changed without affecting the source code order.
In your code, display: flex; is used on the <footer> element to center the text both vertically and horizontally.
 The align-items: center; property-value pair aligns the text vertically, and the justify-content: center; property-value pair aligns the text horizontally.
