The display: flex; property in CSS is used to create a flexible layout on a container element.
It allows the child elements (flex items) to adjust their widths and heights to best fill the available space in the container.

Here are some key features of a flex container:

The flex container's child elements can be laid out in any direction and can have flexible growth and shrink factors.
Flex items can be aligned both horizontally and vertically within the container.
The order of flex items can be changed without affecting the source code order.
In your code, display: flex; is used on the <footer> element to center the text both vertically and horizontally.
 The align-items: center; property-value pair aligns the text vertically, and the justify-content: center; property-value pair aligns the text horizontally.

 The line border-bottom: 1px solid #CCCCCC; is a CSS declaration that adds a border to the bottom of an element.

Here's what each part of the declaration means:

border-bottom: This is the property that specifies the border on the bottom side of an element.
1px: This is the width of the border. In this case, the border is 1 pixel wide.
solid: This is the style of the border. It can be dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, or none. In this case, the border is a solid line.
#CCCCCC: This is the color of the border. It can be a color name, a hexadecimal color, an RGB color, or an HSL color. In this case, the color is a light gray specified by the hexadecimal color #CCCCCC.

If you want .popover (including padding and borders) to be exactly as wide as .filters, you can use the box-sizing: border-box; property in .popover.
